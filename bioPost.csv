Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Inspects the Construction of #Myohaung Officers' Mess and Single Officers’ Quarters for the #Military

Wilberforce Barracks, Freetown, Tuesday 20 October 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has stopped at Wilberforce Barracks to inspect the on-going construction of a five-storey building comprising 104 rooms with all modern facilities for single officers.

The work is expected to be completed and handed over to the government of Sierra Leone at the end of August 2021.

The construction project is a result of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Governments of Sierra Leone and the People’s Republic China, PRC, which included military aid grants to the value of 50 million Yuan ($7.2 million US Dollars).

It could be recalled that the President in late December 2019 turned the sod for the project, emphasising at the time that the future of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, #RSLAF, was in the hands of the junior officers but warned that they must be nurtured and steeped in the military’s ethos, values, and traditions which could best be accomplished in the Officer’s Mess

State House, Freetown, Friday 16 October 2020 - Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation - MCC, Sean Cairncross, has continued his two days' visit to Sierra Leone by meeting His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio today to discuss progress on the threshold programme, which seeks to improve the financial viability of water and electricity sectors in the #WestAfrican nation.

Vice President, Dr Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh, who is supervising the activities of the MCC in the country, said since 2018 there had been a successful implementation of the threshold programme. He confirmed that the country had made tremendous progress on the MCC scorecard, adding that the government had built a strong regulatory framework around the energy and water sector.

“We have made immense gains in the implementation of the threshold programme and the scorecard,” he stated.

In his statement, Mr Cairncross said that he appreciated the progress being made in the implementation of the MCC programmes and congratulated President Bio and the people of Sierra Leone for what he referred to as a marvellous job.

“Your government has done an impressive job on our scorecard. The work done on trafficking and other areas are impressive. This is the commitment that we want to see at the MCC. I want to see progress made in our programmes be sustainable and lasting. This is exciting news and upon my return, I will tell the Board of Directors and Congress in the United States about the progress that Sierra Leone has made,” he explained.

In his response, President Bio thanked Mr Cairncross and his team for visiting Sierra Leone and reiterated that the programmes of the MCC were a needed intervention. He also disclosed that the programmes aligned very well with his government’s priorities, particularly the water and power sectors.

“We are fully committed to completing the threshold programmes because they have laid a solid foundation for our development aspirations. We will embrace them because I know they will further strengthen our partnership,” President Bio assured.

Task Force on Sexual Based Violence Presents Case Study to Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio

State House, Freetown, Friday 16 October 2020 – Members of the task force on sexual and gender based violence in the Office of the First Lady have called at State House to present their report and explain their findings to His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio.

Before their presentation, Her Excellency the First Lady, Madam Fatima Maada Bio, said that the team had put together a quick report on their achievements since they were formed into the task force charged with the responsibility of looking into cases of rape and sexual based violence in the country.

She also stated that the team of very experienced people was also mandated to provide solutions to the many challenges affecting the fight against rape and sexual based violence, adding that that was as important to make sure that women and girls were safe as it was also necessary to attain gender equality.

“Thank you very much, Your Excellency, for making this fight one of your priorities and for believing in this task force to work together to find an everlasting solution that will definitely see the end of Sexual and Gender Based Violence in the country,” she noted.

She added that the task force had a memorandum of understanding with some strategic partners dealing with rape and sexual based violence in the country, citing the likes of Don Bosco, Aberdeen Women’s Centre, the National Emergency Medical Centre, LAWYERS, to help strengthen their commitment to the cause.

“We have also signed an MOU with the Sierra Leone Female Medical Association, a group of young doctors who are willing to work with us in their respective hospitals, to make sure that victims who are brought to the hospitals are treated immediately,” she explained.

Director of Public Prosecution, Easmon Ngakui, said that since President Bio’s Proclamation of a State of Emergency regarding Rape and Sexual Violence in 2019, they had secured 152 convictions. He added that after the establishment of the Sexual Offences Model Court in July this year they had secured 64 convictions.

“We are very happy with the progress so far. There was a culture of silence on rape and sexual based violence in Sierra Leone, but since that pronouncement and after the establishment of the Sexual Offences Model Court, there has been a rapid flow of complaints dating back five years ago,” he said.

The law officer also noted that they had observed that in many cases the perpetrators and children were between the ages of 5 -17 years, and that if something was not done, socially to combat the menace, the country could lose out on the current generation.

In response, President Bio thanked the First Lady and the task force on sexual and gender based violence for their commitment and the things they had done to help in the protection of girls and women.

“This is about our children. As we prepare the grounds for prosecution and case management at different stages, I want us to pay more attention to heightening prevention. If we can, let us prevent it, so we don’t have a reason to go to court or to go to the hospital,” he said.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Conducts Midterm Performance Evaluation of the New Direction Government

Freetown International Conference Center, Bintumani Hotel, Friday 9 October 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has told government officials at a one-day seminar, on Midterm Performance and Evaluation of the New Direction Government, that his government will cater for every Sierra Leonean through an inclusive governance model that leaves no one behind.

He further emphasised that the performance evaluation would provide the platform to engage all ministers, deputy ministers and resident ministers in very frank ways, adding that such a constructive dialogue would give a clear mandate for the change that would transform the country.

The President also stated that he wanted his government to have an effective synergy between the performance management of government service delivery and the monitoring and evaluation of service delivery across government, in a way that would impact on the lives of people.

“With the sense of purpose and clarity after two and half years, I am confident that we have made significant progress on the delivery of our commitments to the people of Sierra Leone, notwithstanding the very adverse problems and challenges posed by COVID 19 pandemic.

“I am informed that this Medium-Term Evaluation Ministerial Retreat organised by the Office of the Chief Minister is aimed at taking an introspection of our tangible interventions as a Government linked to the Manifesto Commitments and Medium-Term National Development Framework. It will also be helpful to discuss what has been delivered outside the Manifesto Commitment and yet still what has not been delivered. I wish you fruitful deliberations,” he said.

Chief Minister, Professor David Francis, said in his opening remarks that the midterm performance and evaluation would review the progress that would have been recorded, the access and challenges to work together to improve on their delivery outcomes. He added that they looked forward to the results for the people of Sierra Leone, and informed the gathering that it was an international best practice not common in Africa.

He said that the dialogue would create a platform to collectively assess the continued relevance of their interventions and strategies and to determine whether they were fit for purpose in their delivery for the people of Sierra Leone.

"Your Excellency, I see this as an opportunity to provide you with tangible evidence, facts and figures of the extent to which you have delivered on your Manifesto Commitments just in two and half years,” he noted.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches First Girls’ School in Port Loko, Emphasises the Nexus Between Education and Development

Port Loko, Northern Province, Thursday 8 October 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has said at the launch of the first and new state-of-the-art girls’ school in the northern district headquarter town, that education is the single most potent enabler that has developed nations and transformed lives.

“There is inherent good in Sierra Leoneans who associate with a clear leadership vision that prioritises education and especially the education of the girl child. Giving every girl, including pregnant girls, access to free quality school education; reinforcing positive role models for girls; and creating the enabling environment for every girl to succeed and be all she can be, is above politics.

“For my Government, education is a right. We are committed to narrowing gender-gaps and providing opportunity for under-served communities. We believe, as a Government, that we must maximise the multiplier effects of investing in the education of girls. That belief aligns with our Medium-Term National Development Plan, the Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 5, and other international human capital development agenda,” he said.

President Bio further noted that the event was about ensuring that girls, irrespective of ethnicity and place of origin, were empowered to contribute their fair share to the development of Sierra Leone. He added that coming three days before the International Day of the Girl Child on 11 October 2020, the opening and naming of the school the ‘Kadi A Sesay Secondary School’ was most auspicious.

“It is even more auspicious because the person after whom we named this school today dared to be and has been unique for her exemplary achievements in academia, her commitment and proficiency in public service, her humility in leadership, her belief in what is right and doing what is right, and her perpetual inspirational presence. She is a veritable role model for me and for millions of Sierra Leonean boys and girls who believe that they can achieve the seemingly impossible and that ceilings are meant to be broken and barriers are meant to be breached,” he said.

The President said: “Her assuring presence, counsel, and energy when the odds are stacked against her are the very stuff that success is made of. Her vision of education and for the education of women, in particular, cannot be captured in words. But she represents three things: that the girl child cannot and should no longer accept artificial cultural and other limitations; that education is transformative for women and that an educated woman is an agent of change for herself, her family, her community, and her nation; and that education is an opportunity for the girl child to be better, make her community and her country better, and give back to her country”.

He said while also thanking Mercury International, the benefactor, he wanted to also encourage other private sector players to complement government’s investment in education and to support his flagship vision of human capital development.

“Ultimately, human capital development expands, deepens, and benefits business and the private sector the most,” he concluded.

Managing Director of Mercury International, Martin Michael, started his statement by recognising those he called the real heroes and champions of the project.

“…the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Dr. David Sengeh, the Delivery team headed by Grace together with Mariama, Eman, Haja Isata Kamara, Resident Minister North West, the consultants, Ideas Limited, the contractors, Kolville Engineering, and of course the Management and Staff, the retailers and customers of Mercury International.

“I have had calls from friends and well-wishers who have indicated a desire to help this school…In addition, I have asked that we acquire the school's bank account number to ensure that the sum of Le 10,000,000 (Ten Million Leones) a month is deducted from my salary at Mercury and paid directly to the account of the school. This is a one-year commitment to assist the school in its formative year,” he disclosed.

Mayor of the Municipality of Port Loko, Abu Bakarr Kamara, thanked the government and Mercury International for the construction of what he described as “a state-of-the-art school” that would help educate the coming generation.

"The establishment of this school will help train future lawyers, doctors and other professionals who will bring development to Port Loko and the country at large," he noted.

Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Dr Moinina David Sengeh, said the establishment of the school in the north was a laudable venture to promote education, particularly that of the girl child.

Minister Sengeh added that the school would focus on science, technology, innovation and other skills in data management that would help solve societal problem
Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches Education Project, Signs US$ 66 Million Education Multi-Donor Trust Fund

State House, Freetown, Monday 5 October 2020 - Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education has today launched the Sierra Leone Education Project and signed a US$ 66 Million 5-year Multi-Donor Trust Fund before His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio.

Welcoming development partners, the Honourable Vice President, Dr Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh, said that the launch of the education project by the World Bank, Irish Aid, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the European Union, EU, showed the importance of partnership in supporting the President. He emphasised that that and other programmes would develop and strengthen the country’s education system.

“Today every Sierra Leonean kid wants to be in school. That explains clearly the Free Education Programme has created a tremendous impact. This has, no doubt, given reasons to His Excellency’s vision to prioritise human capital development as the bedrock of the New Direction Government,” he noted.

The World Bank Country Manager, Gayle Martin, said they were happy to celebrate the first day of the start of the new school term with the launching of the Sierra Leone Education Project, as well as signing the Education Multi-Donor Trust Fund with development partners.

She noted that with Government’s flagship Free Quality Education Programme, the project would be a five-year support to primary and secondary education nationwide, adding that, in particular, the aim was to improve the management of the education system, teaching practice and learning conditions.

“Education is the single-most-important determinant of economic mobility and the importance of investing in education cannot be overemphasised. The World Bank congratulates the efforts of the government of Sierra Leone, the leadership of President Bio in placing education and human capital development, more generally, at the centre of the national development agenda, as articulated in the National Development Plan, and also as reflected in budget allocations since 2018, under challenging macro-fiscal conditions,” she noted.

Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Dr Moinina David Sengeh, said that the event showed a celebration of the education sector as they witnessed the formal kick-off of the Free Education Project. He recalled that when he took up office the first challenge was to restructure the ministry so that it could absorb resources, engage partners and deliver education services to all children; digitalize the ministry through technology that would help do work better; help school leaders lead better, help teacher teach better and also help pupils to learn better.

”I am pleased to report to your Excellency that not only do you have a ministry fit for purpose, we even have an entirely new directorate called Partnership and Resource Mobilisation. We cannot deliver effective services without the right global and local partnerships and efficient resource mobilization approaches. Today is a bold step marker under our belief as a ministry as we reaffirm our partnerships with the World Bank, Irish Aid, the EU, and the Foreign and Commonwealth and Development Office,” he explained.

Dr Sengeh further stated that regardless of the many challenges the world had faced, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ministry recorded many gains, adding that they would continue to work and consult with partners, children, civil society and the private sector.

“We will continue to evolve and transform with evidence data. We are, more than ever, motivated and ready to deliver on our mandate and completely transform the education sector in Sierra Leone,” he assured.

In his remarks, President Bio said the fund was a demonstration of commitment, showing that they valued education and that they were appreciative of government’s effort at investing in human capital development.

He said that access to inclusive and free quality education to every child, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, place of origin socioeconomic or other status, would be transformative for the nation-building agenda, adding that his government had increased budgetary allocation to 21 per cent, increased enrolment and school nutrition programmes, provided free teaching and learning materials and free school buses.

The reports of the various Commissions of Inquiry established by Constitutional Instruments Nos. 64, 65 and 67 of 2018 have been officially published together with their white papers by #HisExcellency Dr. Julius Maada Bio, President of the #Republic of #SierraLeone.

In this episode of our regular video series, see what #PresidentBio, the country's #AttorneyGeneral and #CivilSociety have to say about their commitment to the recovery process, the emphasis on respect for the Rule of Law and warning against any possible disruptions of the process.

"In my inaugural address to this nation, I declared three #peaceful #democratic wars against indiscipline, poverty, and corruption. The nexus among the three is obvious: #indiscipline begets #injustice and bad #governance; #corruption is a product of the former, and it accelerates #poverty, and constrains national #development", he said.
#SierraLeone’s President Julius Maada Bio Receives Reports of Commissions of Inquiry and White Papers, Assures Full Implementation of Reports

State House, Freetown, Thursday 24 September 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has today received the reports of the Commissions of Inquiry and the White Papers and has also assured that government will fully implement the recommendations therein.

“Government has carefully looked at the reports of the Commissions and the recommendations. The White Paper documents the recommendations the Government has accepted in the interest of the people of Sierra Leone. Unlike other Commissions, citizens are assured that this Government will fully implement all recommendations. I repeat, Government will implement all recommendations to the letter,” he said.

The reports of the various #CommissionsofInquiry established by Constitutional Instruments Nos. 64, 65 and 67 of 2018 were officially published together with their white papers.

President Bio, who opened his address to the press with a short announcement of his return from a private visit to Lebanon in excellent health, publicly instructed the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to effect the recommendations of the Commissions of Inquiry and “to recover all monies recommended to be returned to the people of Sierra Leone and to confiscate all assets recommended to be confiscated, and all other such penalties as recommended”.

He, however emphasised respect for the rule of law, adding that: “Persons and entities affected by the recommendation are guaranteed a peaceful and transparent judicial appeals process through which they can seek relief. So let me therefore caution every Sierra Leonean that the rule of law is supreme. Those who may wish to incite or engage in unrest and violence in order to obstruct the process of implementing the full enforcement of the recommendations will be subject to the full force of the law”.

“This is not the last of investigations into #corruption by former leaders. The #ACC and other law enforcement agencies are mandated to investigate issues that the Commissions of Inquiry did not have sufficient time to investigate. Investigations, arrests, and prosecutions for corruption will continue as long as they are permissible in the laws of this country,” he assured.

Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Anthony Yeihwoe Brewah, said that the publication fully complied with the provisions of the 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone and that the White Papers contained the reactions of President Bio’s Government to the recommendations in the report submitted to him. He added that the publication would not only satisfy the constitutional requirements but would also seek to meet the expectations of the general public as to the outcome of the Commissions of Inquiry.

“The Commissions of Inquiry were impartially conducted as the commissioners gave the persons of interests the opportunity to defend allegations that were made against them. Regrettably, the majority did not turn up to account for their stewardship. That notwithstanding, it is trite law that unchallenged evidence is good evidence, and so the commissioners held,” he said.

In this episode of our video series you will read, listen to and watch what President Julius Maada Bio says about his passion for and commitment to making #education a priority for #everychild in #SierraLeone.

“We’ve been talking about #development in #SierraLeone and around the world for a very long time and that is the aspiration for every #government. But for me, I have decided to make #HumanCapitalDevelopment a #flagship programme, because I think and believe, absolutely, that you cannot talk about #development without sound #education.

“I am looking at the future of this country, not just to win #elections. I campaigned on human capital development. Today, we have rolled out #FreeQualityEducation in this country. Every child born in #SierraLeone will have the opportunity to be educated like my own daughter,” President Julius Maada Bio.
In this episode of our video series, we share the joy journalists, civil sociaty and indeed most citizens of Sierra Leone had when the government of Sierra Leone repealed a part of the 55 year-old draconian law that hurt journalism and stifled opposition voices for over five decades.

When the leadership of Sierra Leone Association of Journalists visited State House to register their appreciation for the repeal of the anti press law, the President Dr. Julius Maada Bio had this to say:

“The repeal process has gone so far. People have to be mindful of how they use the media to ensure that they are not misused because people are mindful and sensitive about their reputation. As the representative group, you have to be mindful and make sure that it is not misused because reputations are difficult to build but very easy to destroy,” he said.

His views are reinforced in this video by Ahmed Sahid Nasralla, President of the journalist association and members of the public and the Deputy Minister of Information and Communications.
In this episode of our video series we engage the Director General of the National Social Security and Insurance Trust (NASSIT), Mohamed Fuaad Daboh, who shows us how he worked very hard in the last two years to bring an astonishing turnaround in the business of the scheme.

We also captured some very telling testimonials from beneficiaries of the state retirement and pension scheme.
Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Honours Late Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom

Bank Complex, Kingtom, Friday 14 August 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio today joined other mourners at the Bank Complex in Freetown to honour the late Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland, Her Excellency Agnes Kumba Dugba-Macauley who passed on in early May 2020.

She died in active service in London and her remains brought down to Sierra Leone and will be buried on Sunday 16 August 2020 in her native district of Kono.

In his tribute, President Bio said that the late woman was a special person who touched the lives of many on earth, noting that her departure had created a huge gap to her family, tribe, the ruling Sierra Leone Peoples Party and the country as a whole.

He added that the former High Commissioner was a woman of substance, a relentless and smart woman who would always fight for what she believed in and a patriot who served her country diligently.

She was born on 10 March 1955 and hailed from the Eastern district of Kono. In 2018, she was appointed Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland, a position she occupied until her death.

#SierraLeone’s President Julius Maada Bio hands over Le4 Billion to support Tourism and Hospitality Sectors

Radisson Blu, Freetown, Thursday 13 August 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio today announced Le 4.8 billion ($US 480,000) to support the #tourism and hospitality sectors for the revenues and jobs they lost since the #COVID_19 pandemic in March this year.

“There is general unease that we are on a slippery slope to probably never recovering that sector for as long as #COVID_19 persists…So I want to start by challenging us all to build upon the optimism that we expressed in the #NewDirection manifesto that we can make tourism a key growth sector of our economy. We believed then and we believe now that while showcasing the great beauty and heritage of our nation, we could create jobs and get substantial revenue.

“We argued that we could do so by (i) improving the policy and legal environment; (ii) developing tourism sites and products; (iii) developing tourism infrastructure; (iv) improving, promoting, and marketing our country’s unique image as a safe site for great tourism experiences; (v) developing skills that serve the tourism sector, and (vi) diversifying our tourism products,” he said.

The President further informed the gathering of the collaboration of the Ministry with the National Tourist Board and the Hotel and Tourism Association to collect and collate data on tourist establishments and workers in that sector – from hotels, beach bars, casinos, and nightclubs.

“Based on the data collected, I am therefore pleased to announce that my Government has allocated Four billion, Eight hundred and eighty-three million, Eight hundred and forty thousand Leones (Le4,883,840,000.00) to the hospitality sector as #SocialSafetyNet #WageBill support. This is a three-month wage compensation package that will serve a total of 2,363 workers in the hospitality sector.

“This amount is meant to mitigate the impact of the #pandemic and reduce the economic burden on workers in tourism. It will be distributed equally and fairly right across the entire country to every Sierra Leonean who was registered, irrespective of region, ethnicity, and gender. So whether you are in #Makeni, #PortLoko, #Bo, #Kenema, #Kabala, #Freetown, as long as you fall within the bracket earlier described by the Honourable Minister, you will receive your fair and equal share,” he said.

President Bio also noted that his government had started addressing key sector challenges at a very early stage of the pandemic, with the support of the World Bank, adding that that collaboration resulted in the development of a Strategic Tourism Development Master Plan, a National Tourism #Marketing Strategy, an Island Tourism Development Policy, a #Tourism and #Wildlife Development Policy, an Accommodation Standards and Classification Manual, and an Investor Perception Survey among other initiatives.

“International tour operators have shown a more than keen interest in Sierra Leone tourism. To recount some of our successes over the last one year, we received a group of 300 Danish tourists; the cross-border Budapest-Bamako Rally with over 700 participants terminated here; and a significant number of African-Americans, Gullahs, traced their ancestral roots to Sierra Leone.

“Tourist arrivals surged up by 40% to 107,000 arrivals and tourists spent an estimated US$63 million in the #SierraLeone economy. Bed capacity and occupancy increased with new tourism facilities and the Lumley beach stretch has been developed by locals, creating thousands of jobs for Sierra Leoneans. There is also increased domestic tourism and increased interest in domestic tourist sites from waterfalls to islands and nature reserves and habitats. Recently, the Mambo Waterfalls has become a site of fascination and recreation,” he said.

Minister of Finance, Jacob Jusu Saffa, catalogued a host of safety net programmes already being implemented by the #NewDirection Government as part of its social safety net agenda, which included cash transfer, #schoolfeeding programs, and increasing the minimum wage. He said they had also supported bailouts to critical agencies that had been affected by the #COVID_19 #pandemic.

Minister of Tourism and Cultural Affairs, Madam Memunatu Pratt, thanked the President for tremendously choosing tourism as one of the growth sectors for the diversification of the country’s economy. She said that the launch of the safety net would help to alleviate the level of poverty, especially for those affected.

President of Hotel Association, Johnny Shallop, said that although their industry was drastically affected by the #COVID_19, they were thankful to the government for the intervention and in easing the effects of the pandemic on them. He expressed gratitude to the President and his government for the initiative and their commitment to the tourism industry.

“We in the UN commend the government for its decisive actions that have been taken to prevent the early arrival of the #COVID_19 in the country. We continue to stand by the government, both in its public health response and socio-economic response,” he said.

On his part, President Bio expressed gratitude to the out-going UN boss for the many things they had achieved together while he was in country, especially in the areas of sustainable agriculture and food security, climate change, good governance, expanded access to basic services - including #education, #health, water and #sanitation and #energy, protection and #empowerment of the most #vulnerable.

“You have been part of the many processes we have gone through. We are working so hard to keep the Medium-Term Development Plan on track even in the midst of #COVID_19. You have played your own part here and I want to say thank you for being there for us even with the #COVID_19 and wish you all the best.

“I want to thank the United Nations in Sierra Leone for the successful construction of a specialised #COVID_19 treatment Centre at the 34 Hospital and handing over same to the #Government of #SierraLeone as part of the UN’s support to the national #COVID_19 fight,” he concluded.

Sierra Leone's Anti-Corruption Commission Presents 2019 Annual Report to President Julius Maada Bio

State House, Freetown, Thursday 6 August, 2020 - The Anti-Corruption Commission, ACC, has presented its 2019 Annual Report to His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio as part of its obligations and mandate to account for its stewardship.

Its Deputy Commissioner, Augustine Foday Ngobie, said that they were presenting the report in fulfilment of the provision in Section 19(1) of the ACC Act of 2008 as amended, noting that the report comprehensively chronicled the overall activities of the Commission and captured details on all departments for the year under review.

He said that 2019 could be safely described as a year of remarkable success for the Commission, taking into consideration the achievements and success stories both locally and internationally. He also said that they were able to strengthen the Commission through the amendment of the laws which had made corruption a high risk but low return venture.

“Your Excellency, the Commission remains very grateful to you for the determined and inspiring leadership demonstrated towards the fight against corruption and the general work of the Commission. I also extend our thanks to the Ministry of Finance for its support in the payment of salaries, provision of recurrent expenditure and development,” he said.

In his remarks, President Bio started by commending the leadership and staff of the Commission for the report and for their unwavering commitment to the fight against corruption over the last year.

“Since I assumed office, I have prioritised fighting corruption because it is a threat to our development as a nation. A corrupt country is adverse for economic and social development, foreign direct investment, effective service delivery, fairplay and equal opportunity, equal access to justice and the rule of law.

“Today, the presentation of this report gives us an opportunity to reaffirm my Government’s commitment to fighting this war on corruption. As I say often, this is a war we must fight and it is a war we must win,” he said.

“First, in 2019, I signed into law the Anti-Corruption Amendment Act of 2019 in fulfilment of both a manifesto and public commitment I made…second, the Special Anti-Corruption Division was established in the High Court with five (5) dedicated Judges to exclusively sit on ACC cases…

“Third, the Honourable Vice President, Dr. Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh, on behalf of my Government, launched my Government’s strategic blueprint that includes the public and private sectors in fighting corruption…fourth, our international reputation has been enhanced because our international rating on controlling corruption and corruption perception indices are all very favourable…

“Fifth, Sierra Leone scored 79% in the Millennium Challenge Corporation control of corruption indicator. This was an improvement on the 71% score in 2018 during our very first year in office. Clearly, this was a significant improvement on the failing score of 49% scored by our predecessors…sixth, surveys carried out by independent civil society organisations and funded by foreign governments, indicate significant improvements in fighting corruption,” he concluded.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio meets National Sports Authority Board Members, Assures of Government Support

State House, Freetown, Wednesday 5 August 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has today met with Board Members of the newly constituted National Sports Authority, NSA, and assured them of his government’s support to the development of sports in the country.

Presenting the board, Minister of Sports, Ibrahim Nyelenkeh, thanked the President for the audience, noting that the courtesy call was symbolic because for the first time the country was providing the kind of support required by the NSA. He said he was meeting the President to officially present the board, adding that it was a very lucrative sporting agency that would create jobs across the country.

Chairman of the NSA Board, David Woobay, thanked President Bio for appointing them to rebrand sporting activities in the country in accordance with the New Direction Agenda. He said that the President was known for his successful history with sports in the country and added that they would look at sources of funding to augment government’s allocation to sporting activities in the country.

National Executive Director for the NSA, Kenneth Brima, said that sports stakeholders were proud of the sustained political will, commitment and dedication of the President to supporting the sector. He added that they were thankful to the government for providing the much-needed resources for the roll-out and implementation of the NSA.

In his response, President Bio said that Sierra Leone was once known for its sporting prowess in all disciplines and noted that the New Direction government was about reviving sports and every aspect of human endeavours in the country. While congratulating the new Board members, the President also said that he was very impressed by the personalities in the Board and urged them to do more.

“We have great talents but we need to nurture them and I leave that task to you to help the Sports Ministry to bring these talents together so we can compete again at the international level. We are going to fight and make sure that you get not only the moral support but also the financial support to be able to move things,” he assured.

The NSA exists to coordinate, regulate, promote and support competitive sporting activities with a view to promoting national cohesion, professionalism, excellence in sports and international recognition.

Presenting the team to the President, Minister of Health and Sanitation, Professor Alpha Tejan Wurie, said that the move was a clear manifestation of the cordial relationship that existed between the people and governments of Sierra Leone and #Cuba, adding that it was also reflective of the clear bonding and cooperation between ministries in the New Direction government.

Head of the Cuban Medical Brigade, Bernardo Quintero, thanked the President and people of Sierra Leone for receiving them into the country. He said that they were a group of specialists working with the Sierra Leonean medical team to achieve the government’s objective of fighting the COVID-19.

Cuban Charge’d’ affairs in Sierra Leone, Ambassador Felix Raul Rojas Cruz, recalled that Cuban medical teams had been in Sierra Leone during the Ebola and Mudslide and were again in the country to help fight the COVID-19. While speaking on the historic relationship between the two countries, Ambassador Cruz also noted that the Cuban medical team would contribute once again to the wellbeing of the people of Sierra Leone.

On his part, President Bio thanked the Government and people of the Republic of Cuba for answering to the call of the Government of Sierra Leone by providing 16 medical personnel to support the country in the fight against the #COVID_19. He said that the support provided by #Cuba clearly demonstrated their commitment in solidifying the long-standing bilateral relations between the two countries.

He also assured of government’s commitment to the common objective of both countries, which included the principles towards building a just, peaceful and stable world through cooperation and coordination on both bilateral and multilateral fronts.

“The Government and the people of Sierra Leone further appreciate the Government of the Republic of Cuba’s support in the medical sector in the country, by continuously awarding scholarships, over the years, to students to train in the various medical fields. This has greatly contributed to boosting the healthcare system in the country,” he said.

Sierra Leone’s Julius Maada Bio Launches Post-Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund, Reiterates New Direction Manifesto Commitment

Freetown, Sierra Leone Thursday 30 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has launched the Post-Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund, PERSIF, project to provide basic social services and support local economic livelihoods and job creation, six years after the deadly outbreak that killed thousands.

The two key components and deliverables of the US$12.4 million project would include basic social service delivery - medical equipment and medicines for #Maternity Centres, Primary Health Units, and Community Health Posts – and local economic livelihoods and job creation with the objective of creating access to finance and support economic activity and cross-border trade.

“As speaker after speaker has noted, #Ebola took a heavier toll on our communities where the disease was most prevalent -- especially on our border and some urban communities. Education, a thriving informal economy, healthcare infrastructure, and basic social services collapsed. In the circumstance, vulnerable populations (orphans, the old, the sick, the disabled, women) fared even worse,” he noted.

The president further pointed out that the socio-economic and health indicators since 2014 were still only marginally better in those communities, adding that six years on the deep and painful footprints of the #Ebola #Virus Epidemic were still with Sierra Leoneans, after it claimed thousands and, most importantly, hundreds of the lives of medical workers.

“To get those vulnerable populations and vulnerable communities on the pathway to inclusive and sustainable development, therefore, we emphasised in various clusters of our Medium-Term National Development Plan (2019-2023) that we must put in place critical enablers of socio-economic development and transformation. These include providing basic social services and the regeneration of local economic activity.

“In our New Direction manifesto, we promised ‘efficient and effective management of the state that will make Sierra Leone a significantly better country through, among other things, inclusive politics, inclusive economic growth, inclusive development.’ This means that vulnerable people and vulnerable communities should be accorded an equal chance to thrive. To our minds, uneven investments in development do not make for sustainable development,” he recalled.

President Bio also noted that the very practical enthusiasm, of his government reworking on that since 2018, demonstrated the premium they placed on the outcomes of the PERSIF project, noting that those results were all critical to the human capital development priorities the New Direction government had set itself.

“It is my fervent hope that this project will be implemented without the usual bottlenecks that forestall progress as it is very important to the lives of beneficiaries in those targeted communities. It is also critical to my Government’s agenda of providing economic opportunity to otherwise vulnerable groups and fully including those populations in the development ecosystem.

“So let me conclude by thanking the African Development Bank Group that has worked in partnership with the multinational agency, Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, to provide this grant. With their extra pair of hands, my Government has today implemented programmes that will transform local economies, provide opportunity, and transform the lives of vulnerable populations that continue to be adversely affected by the Ebola scourge six years on,” he said.

Minister of Social Welfare, Baindu Dassama-Kamara, emphasised the importance of providing social services in the selected places, restore livelihood and economic opportunities for affected beneficiaries. She disclosed that the Association of Ebola Survivors was actively involved in the implementation process and noted that the project was expected to improve community response to future outbreaks.

Minister of Finance, Jacob Jusu Saffa, said that through effective re-engagement, the #NewDirection Government had been able to salvage the project, adding that that would go a long way to take care of the Ebola survivors who were abandoned by the previous government. He assured of their determination to effectively implement the project.

Country Manager, African Development Bank Group, Dr Peninah Kariuki, said that the project was special because it addressed special needs of communities affected by the #Ebola outbreak by restoring basic social services and reviving local economic opportunities. She also reaffirmed their commitment to working with the various partners to ensuring the timely implementation of the project.

State Lodge, Freetown, Thursday 30 July 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has today presented sheep for slaughter to 300 mosques and households in the Western Area.

Muslims worldwide celebrate this day in remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim’s (Abraham) willingness to slaughter his own son, Ismael before Allah intervened and ordered him to kill a sheep instead.

He said because of the pandemic Muslims could not perform the Hajj this year, which was an important pillar of Islam. He said that Eid Al Adha (tomorrow) was an important date in the Muslim calendar and had called on them to show their love as a family.

“We are doing the special offer to show that we care for everyone with the little we can offer. Religious leaders are important part of our society and that is why we are making this special offer to show that we care for them,” he said.

He described the engagements as fruitful and noted that the stakeholders were appreciative of the move by President Bio to send a representation. He also thanked his colleagues in the delegation for being instrumental to the success of the numerous engagements they had.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches Sexual Offences Model Court, Praises Hands off Our Girls Initiative

Freetown, Sierra Leone, Friday 24 July 2020 – His Excellency President Julius Maada Bio has launched the country’s first-ever Sexual Offences Model Court, SOMC, in Sierra Leone while saluting the great courage of survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV).

“Be assured that there are Sierra Leoneans and friends of Sierra Leone who care and who will continue to stand with you steadfastly,” he said adding that he was publicly thanking The First Lady, Madam Fatima Maada Bio, for her tenacity in championing the ’Hands Off Our Girls’ campaign that also promotes the cause for women.

“’Hands Off Our Girls’ is not just a statement, it has become a rallying cry of resistance and a trenchant restatement that we will fight back until we rid this country of SGBV. Thank you Madam First Lady for emboldening young girls and women all over this nation that they can and must say ‘NO’ to predators and molesters.

“Thank you for reminding each one of us (parents, community members, traditional and religious leaders, civil servants, members of the security forces, students, professional organisations, civil society, ordinary citizens, and national leaders) that we can and we must play our part in urgently addressing this national emergency. Let us continue to explore new ways of collaborating very closely to change attitudes and end these crimes,” he said.

The President also acknowledged that economic disparities, cultural attitudes, and some all-round obnoxious attitudes toward women and girls had contributed to the deepening of the said crisis in the country.

“But we are a good people. We are a nation of good people. We should be better. We must do more to rid this nation of this menace. As a Government, we have made an unambiguous statement that there is no place for impunity and every perpetrator will be held accountable within the full remit of all existing laws of our country,” he warned.

President Bio also thanked development partners for sharing his belief that the egregious crime of sexual violence must be tackled head-on, adding that he was particularly recognising the role of the UN Women and UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, and for their vigorous and relentless support to the Government and the judiciary.

“Let me also thank my Lord, The Chief Justice and members of the judiciary for their interminable support in fighting SGBV. Over the last two years, they have made a bold statement of their commitment to right this grave injustice by speedily augmenting every step of the fight against SGBV,” he said.

First Lady, Madam Fatima Maada Bio, said that since the launch of the HOOG Campaign they had succeeded in gradually shifting the culture of silence and indifference about rape, thereby increasing the number of reported cases. She noted that the rate of sexual incidences had also provided the platform for human rights and advocacy organisations and individuals to rally together to end all forms of violence against women and girls in the country.

“As part of government’s commitments to ending all forms of violence against women and girls in Sierra Leone, we are here this morning to make another history as a country by officially launching the SOMC. Even as we gathered here this morning, let us remind ourselves of our constitutional and moral responsibility of safeguarding the rights and future of women and girls,” she said.

Country Representative, UNFPA, Dr Kim Eva Dickson, applauded the Government for the concerted multi-sectoral efforts to prevent and eradicate the scourge of gender-based violence that was eating away the fabric of society. She also congratulated the Judiciary of Sierra Leone on the opening of SOMC, saying that the special measure associated with the specialised court would go a long way to building the confidence of survivors to bring their cases forward.

A representative from Rainbow Center, Dr Olabisi Claudius-Cole, thanked the President and the First Lady for putting the spotlight and raising awareness on the menace in the country. She added that the HOOG campaign had made a big impact and difference. She assured of their continued passion and commitment to providing competent, compassionate and confidential care to survivors of SGBV.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Encourages Support from Parents and Communities to End Rape in Sierra Leone

State House, Freetown, Tuesday 14 July 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has encouraged parents and the community to support government’s efforts in tackling rape, early marriage and all forms of violence against women and girls in the country.

Speaking during a high-level stakeholders’ meeting at State House, the President said that it was the responsibility of government to protect the lives of everyone, adding that that could only be achieved with the involvement of parents and members of the community. He emphasised the need to end all harmful practices that were affecting the growth of women and girls in the country.

The President also used the occasion to commend the Rainbow Initiative for their tenacity in doing a very difficult job and for standing for survivors of rape and sexual violence. He noted that the statistics around rape in the country were grim, adding that that was why he declared a national emergency on rape and sexual violence in February 2019.

“Rape is unacceptable because it is about the future of our children. The parents and communities need to stand up because it is better to work towards prevention. Parents should be attentive to raising our children. There is a need for a multisectoral approach and coordination to get rid of impunity,” he said.

First Lady, Her Excellency Fatima Maada Bio, said that they were meeting to brief the President on the task given to them regarding the “Hands Off Our Girls”, HOOG, campaign and how they could find solutions in dealing with rape, teenage pregnancy and early marriage in the country.

She noted that they had gone right across the country to engage relevant stakeholders and to raise awareness about the dangers of rape and sexual violence against women and girls. She also said that since the launch of the HOOG, they had achieved a lot but would still need the cooperation of everyone if they were to achieve their goals.

Executive Director of Rainbow Initiative, Daniel Kettor, said that there had been a lack of support from the community to survivors, saying that that was affecting the fight against rape. He recommended for the acceleration of the One-Stop Centers, assign medical staff to those centers and to establish more safe homes across the country that would minimise the rate at which society and parents compromise on rape matters.

“The Commission reiterates its commitment in strengthening collaboration and greater engagement with government, international partners and key stakeholders for the conduct of credible and transparent elections that meet international standards and the expectations of the people of Sierra Leone,” he said.

In his response, the President thanked the Commission for doing a good job, saying that despite it being a difficult one their job was important in the promotion of democracy in the country. He further implored them to do more about integrity and emphasised that their proper functioning would go a long way to determine the trajectory of democracy in the country.

He also welcomed the progress the Commission had made so far by paying specific attention to gender and disability issues as key pillars in their various initiatives. He added that they wanted to make the process inclusive at all times because of their commitment to inclusive development.

He also assured that government would continue to endeavour to make sure that adequate funding was given to financing the activities of the Commission and implored them to continue to do their best to provide the stability needed for development.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio unveils Support to Civil Society, Local Authorities

UNIMAK, Makeni, Northern Province Friday 10 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has launched the ‘Support to Civil Society and Local Authorities for Local Development’ Project in Makeni to support local development in agriculture, infrastructure, energy, health, education, gender and social protection.

The five-year European Union grant will target District Councils and respective Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Pujehun, Kenema, Bombali and Kambia – to further expand their resource base and institutional capacities to deliver and account for services, bolster linkages and relationships with rural civil societies, and improve the environment for effective decentralisation and local governance.

“The Minister has highlighted my Government’s core achievements over the last two years. From over ten years of dwindling funding, my Government has provided more funds and increased salaries and compensation for local government officials. At the same time, we are working on restructuring and expanding the resource base and institutional capacities of local councils so that they can deliver and account for services in a sustainable way.

“I am particularly pleased about the participation of civil society organisations in formulating, planning, and assessing local development initiatives. Beyond the fact that this fosters a unique and strategic partnership, it also enhances proper accountability for development funds.

“So my expectation is that CSOs should insist on being involved in identifying development priorities and be fully involved in the budget formulation, approval, execution, and monitoring process,” he said, adding that the five-year EU and government programme aligned both with his manifesto commitments and the national development priorities.

“Let me also publicly thank the European Union for its collaborative work with the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists on the TRUEtok bot Corona series. It is regularly broadcast over several media and engages young persons and the public on topics around Corona.

“For all the good work you continue to do, thank you, Ambassador Vens. You are helping save lives. Our high recovery rates and the comparatively low death rates from COVID-19 is cause for optimism. It is also testament to the great spirit of collaboration that is engendered in our relationship with the European Union,” he said.

Minister of Finance, Jacob Jusu Saffa, said that the New Direction Government had manifested more commitment in decentralisation than any other government had done, noting that they had significantly increased expenditure on local councils. He also disclosed that the government had started paying salaries to local council leaders, increased sitting fees to all local councils in the country and were finalising arrangements for the payment of salaries for paramount chiefs and their key staff.

Minister of Local Government and Rural Development, Tamba Lamina, commended the government for the level of support they had given to local councils, saying that that was a manifestation of President Bio’s commitment to the decentralisation process in the country. He stated that they had commenced the process of developing a strategic plan that would engage local stakeholders and development partners while commending the EU for their support to that process.

Head of European Union Delegation in Sierra Leone, Ambassador Tom Vens, said that the aim of the project was to support effective decentralisation and efficient service delivery to the citizens, especially in remote areas. He said that the project would contribute to economic growth and social cohesion for the benefit of Sierra Leone. He also acknowledged the President’s strategy and long-term vision in placing decentralisation at the core of the government’s New Direction.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio unveils One-Stop Centres, Says among Early Adopters of the Concept in Africa

State House, Freetown, Thursday 9 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has told a virtual meeting of the diplomatic community and United Nations leadership in Sierra Leone that the one-stop centres initiative to address Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) cases in referral hospitals is innovative.

“I am proud that we are early adopters of the concept in Africa. We are the second country to adopt One Stop Centres for SGBV response and one of only nine countries in the entire Africa. I am pleased that the six pilot centres will provide one-stop locations for multi-sectoral response services that support survivors," he said.

He said he was particularly happy to learn that the initiative would ensure confidentiality while offering psychosocial counselling, free medical examination and treatment, legal support, and access to safe homes and other referral pathways.

“I acknowledge the recent media furore over the establishment of a Presidential Task Force to advise on rape and…SGBV. At a point, it was a good idea. But the issue of SGBV is so serious that an ad hoc, problem-solving approach is inadequate to address its full implications for inclusive and equal rights, inclusive education and health, inclusive and equal access to opportunity, and inclusive development.

“So late in 2019, I decided instead to set up a stand-alone Ministry of Gender and Children’s Affairs with focused political leadership and a full complement of professional staff who would advise the presidency and national government on gender, draw up appropriate legislation, coordinate partnerships, collaborate across ministries and with international and local partners, engage community stakeholders, make and implement policies, monitor and evaluate programmes, and do even much more. This is far more than an ad-hoc advisory task force,” he recalled.

President Bio further noted that even with the myriad of problems they tackled head-on every day, government’s focus was to provide a more permanent fix for SGBV because the future of the nation depended on women, constituting 51 per cent of its population.

Minister of Gender and Children’s Affairs, Manti Tarawalli, said that the ultimate goal of the centres was to ensure that survivors no longer had to go to the police stations to report cases of SGBV, adding that that singular action would improve on the quality of statement and set the stage for thorough investigations.

Executive Director for UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, commended the President and Government of Sierra Leone for the launch of the initiative, saying that it was another step that marked progress. She said the centre was a clear indication of the urgent need to tackle rape as a weapon of war against women and girls. She also thanked the President for his efforts to make sure that perpetrators faced the law.

UN Resident Coordinator, Sunil Saigal, congratulated the government for the development in the middle of a difficult situation. He said that the establishment of the facility had been a pressing priority in the efforts to improve on the conditions of women and girls in the country, including addressing the need for access to justice, medical, legal and other support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.

He noted that the move was one of several important initiatives that had been taken by the government to address issues of women and girls and assured of UN’s support to the prevention of women and girls against all forms of violence in the country.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Unveils Digital Health Learning Platforms for Healthcare Workers in Bonthe

Mattru Jong, Bonthe District, Southern Province, Friday 3 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has introduced a Mobile Training and Support (MOTS) digital learning platform while also unveiling the pilot distribution of laboratory equipment and uniforms for health workers in Bonthe.

He added that his government was working closely with partners to use digital health platforms to accelerate steps towards achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3 that sought to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being at all ages.

“My Government, through the Ministry of Health and Sanitation’s eHealth Coordination Hub, approached World Vision International to find innovative ways of supporting the remote training of healthcare workers. This technology could also help manage risk communications during public health emergencies and help reduce the high burden of disease, maternal, and child mortality rates through public health messaging.

“For us as a Government, we see use cases for training community health workers for community sensitisations on routine health care delivery and preventive health protocols and advisories during disease outbreaks. For maternal and child health, it can be used for reminding pregnant and lactating mothers about routine antenatal clinic visits and vaccinations,” he said.

The President emphasised that they were closely attentive to a key objective in the Universal Health Coverage goals as laid out by the World Health Organisation, which states that: “the quality of health services should be good enough to improve the health of those receiving services.” He noted that that argument was easy to make because continuous education and training would augment the skills of healthcare professionals.

“Let us consider the overarching context for a moment. The 2019 Demographic and Health Survey reports that Sierra Leone recorded 1,165 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2013. In 2019, Sierra Leone recorded 717 deaths per 100,000 live births – a 38% improvement. Although the figures indicate that we have made significant progress, we could do better. The World Bank – Funded Service Delivery Indicators Survey of 2018 in Sierra Leone, indicated the need for skills upgrade for health workers.

“So we are here in Bonthe District to reaffirm and fulfil some of the commitments we made in our New Direction manifesto before my Government acceded to office two years ago. Within the service delivery matrix, we pledged to develop training infrastructure, provide trained tutors, and ensure that every healthcare facility had a minimum number of technical staff. We also promised to review and upgrade the training curriculum in existing health institutions for all levels of training in order to equip healthcare staff with the requisite skills to provide high-quality patient-centered care,” he said.

While urging the Ministry of Health and Sanitation to explore the possibility of offering State Registered Nurses and Midwifery level courses using this platform, he also noted that his initial impressions, from the presentation, were that the platform was flexible and allowed for updating and expanding content.

“If this is so, then advanced and refresher courses can be developed and offered for healthcare workers depending on their needs. The opportunity for localising content and for audio-visual learning is also quite helpful. Healthcare workers need not travel away from their duty stations for days to attend valuable courses that will enhance their skills. Additionally, with the closure of the UBC Mattru School of Nursing and the moratorium on all SECHN training across the country, this platform could be just right for teaching refresher skills for nursing staff,” he said.

District Medical Officer in Bonthe, Dr Prince Masuba, said that with effective stakeholders’ engagement and continuous sensitisation, they had been able to reduce the impact of COVID-19 in the district and assured that they would continue raising awareness as a way of protecting the lives of their people.

Country Director for World Vision Sierra Leone, James Chifwelu Nkemba, said that they were excited to be a partner to the government in providing quality healthcare services in the country, adding that they had also helped to introduce technology into the healthcare delivery system to reduce maternal mortality in the district.

Minister of Health and Sanitation, Professor Alpha Tejan Wurie, said that Bonthe District had a rich history of training nurses in the country. He noted that government would restart the training program and upgrade the training standards in Mattru Jong. He also said that the government would rehabilitate the historic hospital built and first operated by the United Brethren in Christ missionaries in the 1950s.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Commissions Covid-19 Care and Treatment Facilities, Recognises Partner Interventions in Healthcare Systems

Bo, Southern Province, Thursday 2 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has commissioned Covid-19 care and treatment facilities, the pilot distribution of equipment and uniforms to healthcare workers in Bo, southern Sierra Leone, where he also praised the interventions of partner organisations.

“Enhancing the capacity of healthcare personnel goes beyond simply recruiting and training nurses and other healthcare professionals. It is about making them more efficient in speedily and accurately diagnosing and treating disease conditions presented to them. We also believe that in the absence of accurate diagnosis, the health, and possibly, lives of patients are at grave risk,” he said.

President Bio further noted that diagnostic testing was central to disease surveillance and could be the basis for reliable data on disease prevalence or disease burdens in specific geographical locations. He said the data could help government make evidence-based decisions on allocating resources, distributing medical supplies, training staff, locating healthcare infrastructure, providing health education, and making high-quality treatment available to citizens.

“I am therefore pleased to announce that my Government will be expanding access to diagnostic testing at all regional and district hospitals and eventually to all PHUs by providing laboratory equipment,” he said, adding that his government had also stressed the importance of professionalism in the healthcare profession.

“I come from a profession in which the wearing of uniforms fosters strong esprit d’corps, pride and confidence in the profession, and confidence to live up to the highest standards and expectations. My Government believes that wearing uniforms in the healthcare professions will foster that professional identity and thus lead to greater pride in the profession and greater confidence in performing duties. The professional outlook of healthcare staff in identical uniforms will enhance the trust and confidence that patients and their family members have in the healthcare staff.

"My Government, therefore, believes that to promote professionalism, we should reintroduce and strengthen a uniform wearing policy for healthcare practitioners especially nurses. Under the resilient health systems strengthening and sustainability programme concluded by the Ministries of Finance and Health, my Government will henceforth provide two sets of cadre-specific uniforms for every nurse. I repeat, my Government will provide nurses (CHOs, CHAs, Midwives etc.) with two sets of uniforms free of charge. This will be sustained and replicated throughout the country," he assured.

The President also acknowledged the work of World Vision International for their community-based primary health care interventions with a focus on maternal, new-born, and child health that had kept thousands of mothers and children alive.

He also recognised the contributions of the Open Society Initiative for West Africa (OSIWA) to the country’s health sector, adding that they were grateful and confident of an intensified cooperation and engagement on maintaining these diagnostic facilities, upgrading equipment, training staff, and supporting regulatory oversight.

“Let me, at this juncture, acknowledge the support of OSIWA that has fully funded the refurbishment and repurposing of The Bo Children’s Hospital, which I inspected earlier this morning, as a dedicated COVID-19 treatment facility. Some of the nurses will be re-trained accordingly and the Ministry of Health and Sanitation will support with essential equipment and other consumables.

“In order to treat healthcare workers who may succumb to COVID-19, OSIWA has also fully financed the repurposing of the Infectious Diseases Centre into a treatment centre for health workers. I must acknowledge that the container was first provided by the WHO.

“Let me, therefore, thank OSIWA again for its proactive and speedy support in rehabilitating both the Bo Children’s Hospital and the Infectious Disease Centre. They have considerably strengthened our capacity to respond to the ravaging menace of COVID-19. These facilities are concrete and enduring interventions that will outlive Corona and boost our healthcare infrastructure.

“As a Government and country, we deeply appreciate OSIWA’s work in promoting human rights; eradicating Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV); supporting community-based justice mechanisms implemented by the legal aid board and civil society partners; promoting accountability; and facilitating the active participation of citizens in governance processes. My Government looks forward to deepening its partnership with OSIWA as we strive to establish the Peace and National Cohesion Commission,” he said.

State House, Freetown, Monday 29 June 2020 - The new Chief of Defence Staff of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, RSLAF, Lieutenant-General Sullay Ibrahim Sesay and the Joint-Force Commander, Major-General Peter K Lavahun, have subscribed to the Oath of Office before His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio.

The new Army Chief, who replaced Lieutenant-General Brima Bureh Sesay, was promoted to Lieutenant-General while the new Joint Force Commander was promoted to Major-General and decorated by the President, who doubled as the Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces.

In his statement, President Bio congratulated the senior officers on their appointments and promotions, noting that their elevation brought with it bigger responsibilities. He said he had meticulously chosen them because he wanted more from them in order to regain the glory of the RSLAF as a force that was respected in the country and beyond. He added that much was expected from them after their commissions and promotions.

“I need not remind you that the task ahead is daunting and can be daunting at times but you have a shoulder in me to always rest on. As a government, our aim is to develop this nation and in that process, we need your support. The Armed Forces form an important element in the development of any nation and we hope that you will provide the leadership necessary,” he said.

Lieutenant-General Sesay thanked and appreciated the President and people of Sierra Leone for the confidence reposed in them as senior military leaders to assume the responsibility for the operational control and administration of the RSLAF. He expressed the belief that with their experience and competence, they would not betray the confidence. He promised that they would progressively drive the RSLAF into the future in support of the New Direction Agenda.

“I thank you for your good leadership as our Commander-In-Chief of the RSLAF and your good dreams for your great institution – the RSLAF. We continue to relentlessly pledge our loyalty and commitments to you and the people of Sierra Leone now and always,” he assured.

UN Chief Pays Courtesy Call on State House, Presents Letter of Appointment to Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio

State House, Freetown, Thursday 22 October, 2020 - The new United Nations Resident Coordinator to Sierra Leone, Babatunde Ahonsi, has called on President Dr Julius Maada Bio to present his letter of appointment by the UN Secretary General.

”It is with utmost humility and great honour that I present my credentials as the United Nations Resident Coordinator appointed by His Excellency, the United Nations Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, to serve in Sierra Leone. I am privileged that your excellency speedily approved my designation and wish to express my sincere appreciation and profound gratitude.

“I am cognizant of the fruitful relations that exist between the Government of Sierra Leone and the UN system. Thus, I am eager to deepen UN partnerships with the Government, and our other partners in development towards accelerating the country’s quest for the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and a middle-income country status,” he said.

Mr Ahonsi noted that 2020 had been a challenging year worldwide, especially for Sierra Leone, after having gone through Ebola between 2014 and 2016 to be affected again by the COVID-19 pandemic. He added that despite those health challenges and their adverse development impacts, the admirable resilience of the people of Sierra Leone had kept the country going.

”Your Excellency, this is a time for a change. We can defeat COVID-19 by being responsible citizens and heeding the call of our health experts. Sierra Leone needs all of us to overcome this outbreak. While we are still battling this virus, the UN system in Sierra Leone remains committed to supporting your Government not only with the health response but also with recovery,” he explained.

In his remarks, President Bio welcomed the new UN chief and congratulated him on his appointment, noting that he had taken office at a very difficult time the world over. He agreed with him that the novel Coronavirus was really ravaging the lives of people and the economies of the world.

“Sierra Leone and the United Nations system enjoy a very strong, multilateral and beneficial relationship. I think we are contributing to the UN success around the world. You are going to build on that very good relationship that my country has with the UN,” he said.

The President reiterated that the UN had supported Sierra Leone in achieving its sustainable development goals that would foster developments.

“The country had identified Peace and National Cohesion as a means that would provide the ecosystem for sustainable economic development. We are putting our own architecture together that pays specific attention, at all times, to instigators of violence and unrest. We believe that those fundamental grievances that are left unaddressed can lead to challenges and political upheaval. We want to make sure that they are addressed within a framework,” he noted.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches 2020 Poppy Day Remembrance Week

State House, Freetown, Thursday 22 October, 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has launched the 2020 Poppy Remembrance Week in honour of all military servicemen and women who lost their lives in the line of duty.

Co-Chairman Remembrance Day Planning Committee, Commissioner Rashid Thomas II, said remembering the Poppy Day was often done by Heads of State, particularly those of the Commonwealth of Nations.

He added that the commemoration of the day on 11 November every year was for the over 20 million officers who died during the World War. He noted that the ceremony is always preceded by a thanksgiving service.

Making statement on behalf of the Sierra Leone Ex–Servicemen Association, Acting President Lieutenant Colonel Rtd. Dominic Sowa, said that they had always celebrated the Poppy Day as an affiliate to the Royal Commonwealth Ex-Services League in observing a moment of reflection of their colleagues that lost their lives in the two World Wars and the eleven-year civil war in Sierra Leone.

“The significance of the National Remembrance Day is to demonstrate to the citizenry that those who lost their lives in the defense of their motherland are not only remembered but honoured in a very special way,” he said.

Before launching the 2020 Poppy Week Remembrance celebration, His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio said that all over the Commonwealth of Nations the Poppy Day was being celebrated to show respect to the fallen, the wounded and all those servicemen and women who had served in various conflicts since 1914.

“From Somme to Gallipoli; from the northern Sahara to Burma; and in various theatres from the Congo, Darfur Somalia, Liberia and back home in Sierra Leone, our men and women have served with gallantry and distinction. We honour their valour; we salute their great courage, and we will forever remember their sacrifices,” he said.

The President urged the Ex–Servicemen Association to continue to be peaceful and law-abiding just as they served the country with passion and dignity. He urged them to continue to contribute meaningfully to the security and development of the country.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Commissions Four Inshore Patrol Craft for the Navy

Navy Headquarters, Murray Town, Thursday 22 October, 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has commissioned four inshore patrol craft at the White Man’s Bay Navy Headquarters in Freetown.

Commander of the Maritime Wing, Captain Navy Philip Juana, told the ceremony that the role of the Navy was to protect the territorial waters and its ecosystem, adding that the task was difficult to perform because their military wing didn’t have the necessary platform to effectively function.

He explained that the goats came at the right time, noting that the gifted patrols craft would be used to protect the waters in the country.

Chief of Defense Staff, Lieutenant-General Sullay Ibrahim Sesay, registered his profound appreciation to the government and people of South Korea for the donation. He noted that the general peace and maintenance of the rule of law within the territorial waters of Sierra Leone had been undermined by piracy, sea robbery, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.

“To that fact, I would like to stress that the gifted patrol craft will leverage the flexibility of our Maritime Wing to switch between the two principal roles in supporting all national efforts at achieving our defense and developmental aspirations,” he explained.

While handing over the inshore patrol craft, representative of the South Korean Ambassador, Mr. Kim Sung Nyeon, commended the President for the strong leadership he had exhibited and his government’s tremendous success in the fight against Covid-19.

“And now, Korea is proud to deliver four speedboats to Sierra Leone. It is our hope that today’s contribution will not only help Sierra Leone’s effort to build up its maritime capabilities, but it will also make our friendship grow stronger,” he noted.

In his statement, President Julius Maada Bio said as a nation, Sierra Leone had to contend with large scale plunder of her marine resources through illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.

He noted that within the country’s 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone alone, such illegal, unregulated, and unreported loots by foreign vessels, were estimated to have cost the small West African nation over 26 million dollars in revenue loss, thousands of jobs, loss of livelihoods for coastal and other communities that could otherwise benefit from an agile fishing industry, and great shortage of fish on the local market.

“There is a threat to food security, livelihoods, economic development, and sustainable fisheries management that our small nation can ill-afford.

“Add this to the millions of dollars lost to other such illegal activities as tax evasion; under-reporting of fish catch, and overfishing of our waters that degrade our marine environment and strip local fishing communities of their livelihoods, and the real cost of these illegal acts by illegal foreign vessels mounts,” he said.

He emphasised that the country would no longer afford the cost of such criminal activities as unregulated immigration, contraband smuggling, narcotics, human trafficking and labour rights, robbery at sea, and sea piracy.

“These collectively undermine the rule of law and the steady economic gains we are making as a nation.

“I must also note that our brave men and women of the Sierra Leone Navy and members of the maritime agency are first responders in search and rescue operations when boats are stranded or stricken at sea. We cannot afford to lose precious lives in more sea accidents.

“Sierra Leone truly appreciates the Republic of Korea’s commitment to cooperating towards the development goals outlined in Sierra Leone’s Medium-Term National Development Plan. I, therefore, thank the Government and People of The Republic of Korea through Your Excellency, Mr. Lee-in Tae,” he said.

The President assured that Sierra Leone would also commit to working within the Korea-Africa Framework of Cooperation, 2017-2021, in order to enhance cooperation on trade, manufacturing, industrial development, agriculture, telecommunications, human resource development, science and technology, infrastructural development, and the blue economy, among others.

“Sierra Leone truly appreciates the Republic of Korea’s commitment to cooperating towards the development goals outlined in Sierra Leone’s Medium Term National Development Plan.

“I also want to thank the leadership of the Ministry of Defence for their relentless efforts at augmenting the capacity and training of our armed forces. I thank you for your commitment to working towards achieving my Government’s goal of revitalizing the Joint Maritime Committee (JMC) and implementing effective and sustainable surveillance and security systems in Sierra Leone’s waters,”

He concluded by officially commissioning the four Inshore Patrol Craft (IPC 01, 02, 03, and 04) into service.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Inspects the Construction of #Myohaung Officers' Mess and Single Officers’ Quarters for the #Military

Wilberforce Barracks, Freetown, Tuesday 20 October 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has stopped at Wilberforce Barracks to inspect the on-going construction of a five-storey building comprising 104 rooms with all modern facilities for single officers.

The work is expected to be completed and handed over to the government of Sierra Leone at the end of August 2021.

The construction project is a result of a Memorandum of Understanding between the Governments of Sierra Leone and the People’s Republic China, PRC, which included military aid grants to the value of 50 million Yuan ($7.2 million US Dollars).

It could be recalled that the President in late December 2019 turned the sod for the project, emphasising at the time that the future of the Republic of Sierra Leone Armed Forces, #RSLAF, was in the hands of the junior officers but warned that they must be nurtured and steeped in the military’s ethos, values, and traditions which could best be accomplished in the Officer’s Mess

CEO for #MCC Visits Sierra Leone, Discusses Support to Threshold Programmes on Water and Energy

State House, Freetown, Friday 16 October 2020 - Chief Executive Officer of the Millennium Challenge Corporation - MCC, Sean Cairncross, has continued his two days' visit to Sierra Leone by meeting His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio today to discuss progress on the threshold programme, which seeks to improve the financial viability of water and electricity sectors in the #WestAfrican nation.

While in Freetown, between October 15 and 16, he will follow up on the activities of the US government-funded $44.4 million threshold programme being implemented by the Millennium Challenge Coordinating Unit in the Office of the Vice President.

The independent US Government agency works to reduce global poverty through economic growth. Created in 2004, MCC provides time-limited grants and assistance to poor countries like Sierra Leone that meet rigorous standards for good governance, from fighting corruption to respecting democratic rights.

Vice President, Dr Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh, who is supervising the activities of the MCC in the country, said since 2018 there had been a successful implementation of the threshold programme. He confirmed that the country had made tremendous progress on the MCC scorecard, adding that the government had built a strong regulatory framework around the energy and water sector.

“We have made immense gains in the implementation of the threshold programme and the scorecard,” he stated.

In his statement, Mr Cairncross said that he appreciated the progress being made in the implementation of the MCC programmes and congratulated President Bio and the people of Sierra Leone for what he referred to as a marvellous job.

“Your government has done an impressive job on our scorecard. The work done on trafficking and other areas are impressive. This is the commitment that we want to see at the MCC. I want to see progress made in our programmes be sustainable and lasting. This is exciting news and upon my return, I will tell the Board of Directors and Congress in the United States about the progress that Sierra Leone has made,” he explained.

In his response, President Bio thanked Mr Cairncross and his team for visiting Sierra Leone and reiterated that the programmes of the MCC were a needed intervention. He also disclosed that the programmes aligned very well with his government’s priorities, particularly the water and power sectors.

“We are fully committed to completing the threshold programmes because they have laid a solid foundation for our development aspirations. We will embrace them because I know they will further strengthen our partnership,” President Bio assured.

Task Force on Sexual Based Violence Presents Case Study to Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio

State House, Freetown, Friday 16 October 2020 – Members of the task force on sexual and gender based violence in the Office of the First Lady have called at State House to present their report and explain their findings to His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio.

Before their presentation, Her Excellency the First Lady, Madam Fatima Maada Bio, said that the team had put together a quick report on their achievements since they were formed into the task force charged with the responsibility of looking into cases of rape and sexual based violence in the country.

She also stated that the team of very experienced people was also mandated to provide solutions to the many challenges affecting the fight against rape and sexual based violence, adding that that was as important to make sure that women and girls were safe as it was also necessary to attain gender equality.

“Thank you very much, Your Excellency, for making this fight one of your priorities and for believing in this task force to work together to find an everlasting solution that will definitely see the end of Sexual and Gender Based Violence in the country,” she noted.

She added that the task force had a memorandum of understanding with some strategic partners dealing with rape and sexual based violence in the country, citing the likes of Don Bosco, Aberdeen Women’s Centre, the National Emergency Medical Centre, LAWYERS, to help strengthen their commitment to the cause.

“We have also signed an MOU with the Sierra Leone Female Medical Association, a group of young doctors who are willing to work with us in their respective hospitals, to make sure that victims who are brought to the hospitals are treated immediately,” she explained.

Director of Public Prosecution, Easmon Ngakui, said that since President Bio’s Proclamation of a State of Emergency regarding Rape and Sexual Violence in 2019, they had secured 152 convictions. He added that after the establishment of the Sexual Offences Model Court in July this year they had secured 64 convictions.

“We are very happy with the progress so far. There was a culture of silence on rape and sexual based violence in Sierra Leone, but since that pronouncement and after the establishment of the Sexual Offences Model Court, there has been a rapid flow of complaints dating back five years ago,” he said.

The law officer also noted that they had observed that in many cases the perpetrators and children were between the ages of 5 -17 years, and that if something was not done, socially to combat the menace, the country could lose out on the current generation.

In response, President Bio thanked the First Lady and the task force on sexual and gender based violence for their commitment and the things they had done to help in the protection of girls and women.

“This is about our children. As we prepare the grounds for prosecution and case management at different stages, I want us to pay more attention to heightening prevention. If we can, let us prevent it, so we don’t have a reason to go to court or to go to the hospital,” he said.

“With the sense of purpose and clarity after two and half years, I am confident that we have made significant progress on the delivery of our commitments to the people of Sierra Leone, notwithstanding the very adverse problems and challenges posed by COVID 19 pandemic.

“I am informed that this Medium-Term Evaluation Ministerial Retreat organised by the Office of the Chief Minister is aimed at taking an introspection of our tangible interventions as a Government linked to the Manifesto Commitments and Medium-Term National Development Framework. It will also be helpful to discuss what has been delivered outside the Manifesto Commitment and yet still what has not been delivered. I wish you fruitful deliberations,” he said.

Chief Minister, Professor David Francis, said in his opening remarks that the midterm performance and evaluation would review the progress that would have been recorded, the access and challenges to work together to improve on their delivery outcomes. He added that they looked forward to the results for the people of Sierra Leone, and informed the gathering that it was an international best practice not common in Africa.

He said that the dialogue would create a platform to collectively assess the continued relevance of their interventions and strategies and to determine whether they were fit for purpose in their delivery for the people of Sierra Leone.

"Your Excellency, I see this as an opportunity to provide you with tangible evidence, facts and figures of the extent to which you have delivered on your Manifesto Commitments just in two and half years,” he noted.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches First Girls’ School in Port Loko, Emphasises the Nexus Between Education and Development

Port Loko, Northern Province, Thursday 8 October 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has said at the launch of the first and new state-of-the-art girls’ school in the northern district headquarter town, that education is the single most potent enabler that has developed nations and transformed lives.

“There is inherent good in Sierra Leoneans who associate with a clear leadership vision that prioritises education and especially the education of the girl child. Giving every girl, including pregnant girls, access to free quality school education; reinforcing positive role models for girls; and creating the enabling environment for every girl to succeed and be all she can be, is above politics.

“For my Government, education is a right. We are committed to narrowing gender-gaps and providing opportunity for under-served communities. We believe, as a Government, that we must maximise the multiplier effects of investing in the education of girls. That belief aligns with our Medium-Term National Development Plan, the Sustainable Development Goals 4 and 5, and other international human capital development agenda,” he said.

President Bio further noted that the event was about ensuring that girls, irrespective of ethnicity and place of origin, were empowered to contribute their fair share to the development of Sierra Leone. He added that coming three days before the International Day of the Girl Child on 11 October 2020, the opening and naming of the school the ‘Kadi A Sesay Secondary School’ was most auspicious.

“It is even more auspicious because the person after whom we named this school today dared to be and has been unique for her exemplary achievements in academia, her commitment and proficiency in public service, her humility in leadership, her belief in what is right and doing what is right, and her perpetual inspirational presence. She is a veritable role model for me and for millions of Sierra Leonean boys and girls who believe that they can achieve the seemingly impossible and that ceilings are meant to be broken and barriers are meant to be breached,” he said.

The President said: “Her assuring presence, counsel, and energy when the odds are stacked against her are the very stuff that success is made of. Her vision of education and for the education of women, in particular, cannot be captured in words. But she represents three things: that the girl child cannot and should no longer accept artificial cultural and other limitations; that education is transformative for women and that an educated woman is an agent of change for herself, her family, her community, and her nation; and that education is an opportunity for the girl child to be better, make her community and her country better, and give back to her country”.

He said while also thanking Mercury International, the benefactor, he wanted to also encourage other private sector players to complement government’s investment in education and to support his flagship vision of human capital development.

“Ultimately, human capital development expands, deepens, and benefits business and the private sector the most,” he concluded.

Managing Director of Mercury International, Martin Michael, started his statement by recognising those he called the real heroes and champions of the project.

“…the Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Dr. David Sengeh, the Delivery team headed by Grace together with Mariama, Eman, Haja Isata Kamara, Resident Minister North West, the consultants, Ideas Limited, the contractors, Kolville Engineering, and of course the Management and Staff, the retailers and customers of Mercury International.

“I have had calls from friends and well-wishers who have indicated a desire to help this school…In addition, I have asked that we acquire the school's bank account number to ensure that the sum of Le 10,000,000 (Ten Million Leones) a month is deducted from my salary at Mercury and paid directly to the account of the school. This is a one-year commitment to assist the school in its formative year,” he disclosed.

Mayor of the Municipality of Port Loko, Abu Bakarr Kamara, thanked the government and Mercury International for the construction of what he described as “a state-of-the-art school” that would help educate the coming generation.

"The establishment of this school will help train future lawyers, doctors and other professionals who will bring development to Port Loko and the country at large," he noted.

Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Dr Moinina David Sengeh, said the establishment of the school in the north was a laudable venture to promote education, particularly that of the girl child.

Minister Sengeh added that the school would focus on science, technology, innovation and other skills in data management that would help solve societal problem
Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches Education Project, Signs US$ 66 Million Education Multi-Donor Trust Fund

State House, Freetown, Monday 5 October 2020 - Ministry of Basic and Senior Secondary Education has today launched the Sierra Leone Education Project and signed a US$ 66 Million 5-year Multi-Donor Trust Fund before His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio.

Welcoming development partners, the Honourable Vice President, Dr Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh, said that the launch of the education project by the World Bank, Irish Aid, Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the European Union, EU, showed the importance of partnership in supporting the President. He emphasised that that and other programmes would develop and strengthen the country’s education system.

“Today every Sierra Leonean kid wants to be in school. That explains clearly the Free Education Programme has created a tremendous impact. This has, no doubt, given reasons to His Excellency’s vision to prioritise human capital development as the bedrock of the New Direction Government,” he noted.

The World Bank Country Manager, Gayle Martin, said they were happy to celebrate the first day of the start of the new school term with the launching of the Sierra Leone Education Project, as well as signing the Education Multi-Donor Trust Fund with development partners.

She noted that with Government’s flagship Free Quality Education Programme, the project would be a five-year support to primary and secondary education nationwide, adding that, in particular, the aim was to improve the management of the education system, teaching practice and learning conditions.

“Education is the single-most-important determinant of economic mobility and the importance of investing in education cannot be overemphasised. The World Bank congratulates the efforts of the government of Sierra Leone, the leadership of President Bio in placing education and human capital development, more generally, at the centre of the national development agenda, as articulated in the National Development Plan, and also as reflected in budget allocations since 2018, under challenging macro-fiscal conditions,” she noted.

Minister of Basic and Senior Secondary Education, Dr Moinina David Sengeh, said that the event showed a celebration of the education sector as they witnessed the formal kick-off of the Free Education Project. He recalled that when he took up office the first challenge was to restructure the ministry so that it could absorb resources, engage partners and deliver education services to all children; digitalize the ministry through technology that would help do work better; help school leaders lead better, help teacher teach better and also help pupils to learn better.

”I am pleased to report to your Excellency that not only do you have a ministry fit for purpose, we even have an entirely new directorate called Partnership and Resource Mobilisation. We cannot deliver effective services without the right global and local partnerships and efficient resource mobilization approaches. Today is a bold step marker under our belief as a ministry as we reaffirm our partnerships with the World Bank, Irish Aid, the EU, and the Foreign and Commonwealth and Development Office,” he explained.

Dr Sengeh further stated that regardless of the many challenges the world had faced, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ministry recorded many gains, adding that they would continue to work and consult with partners, children, civil society and the private sector.

“We will continue to evolve and transform with evidence data. We are, more than ever, motivated and ready to deliver on our mandate and completely transform the education sector in Sierra Leone,” he assured.

In his remarks, President Bio said the fund was a demonstration of commitment, showing that they valued education and that they were appreciative of government’s effort at investing in human capital development.

He said that access to inclusive and free quality education to every child, regardless of their gender, ethnicity, place of origin socioeconomic or other status, would be transformative for the nation-building agenda, adding that his government had increased budgetary allocation to 21 per cent, increased enrolment and school nutrition programmes, provided free teaching and learning materials and free school buses.

The reports of the various Commissions of Inquiry established by Constitutional Instruments Nos. 64, 65 and 67 of 2018 have been officially published together with their white papers by #HisExcellency Dr. Julius Maada Bio, President of the #Republic of #SierraLeone.

In this episode of our regular video series, see what #PresidentBio, the country's #AttorneyGeneral and #CivilSociety have to say about their commitment to the recovery process, the emphasis on respect for the Rule of Law and warning against any possible disruptions of the process.

"In my inaugural address to this nation, I declared three #peaceful #democratic wars against indiscipline, poverty, and corruption. The nexus among the three is obvious: #indiscipline begets #injustice and bad #governance; #corruption is a product of the former, and it accelerates #poverty, and constrains national #development", he said.
#SierraLeone’s President Julius Maada Bio Receives Reports of Commissions of Inquiry and White Papers, Assures Full Implementation of Reports

State House, Freetown, Thursday 24 September 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has today received the reports of the Commissions of Inquiry and the White Papers and has also assured that government will fully implement the recommendations therein.

“Government has carefully looked at the reports of the Commissions and the recommendations. The White Paper documents the recommendations the Government has accepted in the interest of the people of Sierra Leone. Unlike other Commissions, citizens are assured that this Government will fully implement all recommendations. I repeat, Government will implement all recommendations to the letter,” he said.

The reports of the various #CommissionsofInquiry established by Constitutional Instruments Nos. 64, 65 and 67 of 2018 were officially published together with their white papers.

President Bio, who opened his address to the press with a short announcement of his return from a private visit to Lebanon in excellent health, publicly instructed the office of the Attorney General and Minister of Justice to effect the recommendations of the Commissions of Inquiry and “to recover all monies recommended to be returned to the people of Sierra Leone and to confiscate all assets recommended to be confiscated, and all other such penalties as recommended”.

He, however emphasised respect for the rule of law, adding that: “Persons and entities affected by the recommendation are guaranteed a peaceful and transparent judicial appeals process through which they can seek relief. So let me therefore caution every Sierra Leonean that the rule of law is supreme. Those who may wish to incite or engage in unrest and violence in order to obstruct the process of implementing the full enforcement of the recommendations will be subject to the full force of the law”.

“This is not the last of investigations into #corruption by former leaders. The #ACC and other law enforcement agencies are mandated to investigate issues that the Commissions of Inquiry did not have sufficient time to investigate. Investigations, arrests, and prosecutions for corruption will continue as long as they are permissible in the laws of this country,” he assured.

Attorney General and Minister of Justice, Anthony Yeihwoe Brewah, said that the publication fully complied with the provisions of the 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone and that the White Papers contained the reactions of President Bio’s Government to the recommendations in the report submitted to him. He added that the publication would not only satisfy the constitutional requirements but would also seek to meet the expectations of the general public as to the outcome of the Commissions of Inquiry.

“The Commissions of Inquiry were impartially conducted as the commissioners gave the persons of interests the opportunity to defend allegations that were made against them. Regrettably, the majority did not turn up to account for their stewardship. That notwithstanding, it is trite law that unchallenged evidence is good evidence, and so the commissioners held,” he said.

In this episode of our video series you will read, listen to and watch what President Julius Maada Bio says about his passion for and commitment to making #education a priority for #everychild in #SierraLeone.

“We’ve been talking about #development in #SierraLeone and around the world for a very long time and that is the aspiration for every #government. But for me, I have decided to make #HumanCapitalDevelopment a #flagship programme, because I think and believe, absolutely, that you cannot talk about #development without sound #education.

“I am looking at the future of this country, not just to win #elections. I campaigned on human capital development. Today, we have rolled out #FreeQualityEducation in this country. Every child born in #SierraLeone will have the opportunity to be educated like my own daughter,” President Julius Maada Bio.
In this episode of our video series, we share the joy journalists, civil sociaty and indeed most citizens of Sierra Leone had when the government of Sierra Leone repealed a part of the 55 year-old draconian law that hurt journalism and stifled opposition voices for over five decades.

When the leadership of Sierra Leone Association of Journalists visited State House to register their appreciation for the repeal of the anti press law, the President Dr. Julius Maada Bio had this to say:

“The repeal process has gone so far. People have to be mindful of how they use the media to ensure that they are not misused because people are mindful and sensitive about their reputation. As the representative group, you have to be mindful and make sure that it is not misused because reputations are difficult to build but very easy to destroy,” he said.

His views are reinforced in this video by Ahmed Sahid Nasralla, President of the journalist association and members of the public and the Deputy Minister of Information and Communications.
In this episode of our video series we engage the Director General of the National Social Security and Insurance Trust (NASSIT), Mohamed Fuaad Daboh, who shows us how he worked very hard in the last two years to bring an astonishing turnaround in the business of the scheme.

We also captured some very telling testimonials from beneficiaries of the state retirement and pension scheme.
Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Honours Late Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom

Bank Complex, Kingtom, Friday 14 August 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio today joined other mourners at the Bank Complex in Freetown to honour the late Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland, Her Excellency Agnes Kumba Dugba-Macauley who passed on in early May 2020.

In his tribute, President Bio said that the late woman was a special person who touched the lives of many on earth, noting that her departure had created a huge gap to her family, tribe, the ruling Sierra Leone Peoples Party and the country as a whole.

He added that the former High Commissioner was a woman of substance, a relentless and smart woman who would always fight for what she believed in and a patriot who served her country diligently.

She was born on 10 March 1955 and hailed from the Eastern district of Kono. In 2018, she was appointed Deputy High Commissioner to the United Kingdom and Ireland, a position she occupied until her death.

#SierraLeone’s President Julius Maada Bio hands over Le4 Billion to support Tourism and Hospitality Sectors

Radisson Blu, Freetown, Thursday 13 August 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio today announced Le 4.8 billion ($US 480,000) to support the #tourism and hospitality sectors for the revenues and jobs they lost since the #COVID_19 pandemic in March this year.

“There is general unease that we are on a slippery slope to probably never recovering that sector for as long as #COVID_19 persists…So I want to start by challenging us all to build upon the optimism that we expressed in the #NewDirection manifesto that we can make tourism a key growth sector of our economy. We believed then and we believe now that while showcasing the great beauty and heritage of our nation, we could create jobs and get substantial revenue.

“We argued that we could do so by (i) improving the policy and legal environment; (ii) developing tourism sites and products; (iii) developing tourism infrastructure; (iv) improving, promoting, and marketing our country’s unique image as a safe site for great tourism experiences; (v) developing skills that serve the tourism sector, and (vi) diversifying our tourism products,” he said.

The President further informed the gathering of the collaboration of the Ministry with the National Tourist Board and the Hotel and Tourism Association to collect and collate data on tourist establishments and workers in that sector – from hotels, beach bars, casinos, and nightclubs.

“Based on the data collected, I am therefore pleased to announce that my Government has allocated Four billion, Eight hundred and eighty-three million, Eight hundred and forty thousand Leones (Le4,883,840,000.00) to the hospitality sector as #SocialSafetyNet #WageBill support. This is a three-month wage compensation package that will serve a total of 2,363 workers in the hospitality sector.

“This amount is meant to mitigate the impact of the #pandemic and reduce the economic burden on workers in tourism. It will be distributed equally and fairly right across the entire country to every Sierra Leonean who was registered, irrespective of region, ethnicity, and gender. So whether you are in #Makeni, #PortLoko, #Bo, #Kenema, #Kabala, #Freetown, as long as you fall within the bracket earlier described by the Honourable Minister, you will receive your fair and equal share,” he said.

President Bio also noted that his government had started addressing key sector challenges at a very early stage of the pandemic, with the support of the World Bank, adding that that collaboration resulted in the development of a Strategic Tourism Development Master Plan, a National Tourism #Marketing Strategy, an Island Tourism Development Policy, a #Tourism and #Wildlife Development Policy, an Accommodation Standards and Classification Manual, and an Investor Perception Survey among other initiatives.

“International tour operators have shown a more than keen interest in Sierra Leone tourism. To recount some of our successes over the last one year, we received a group of 300 Danish tourists; the cross-border Budapest-Bamako Rally with over 700 participants terminated here; and a significant number of African-Americans, Gullahs, traced their ancestral roots to Sierra Leone.

“Tourist arrivals surged up by 40% to 107,000 arrivals and tourists spent an estimated US$63 million in the #SierraLeone economy. Bed capacity and occupancy increased with new tourism facilities and the Lumley beach stretch has been developed by locals, creating thousands of jobs for Sierra Leoneans. There is also increased domestic tourism and increased interest in domestic tourist sites from waterfalls to islands and nature reserves and habitats. Recently, the Mambo Waterfalls has become a site of fascination and recreation,” he said.

Minister of Finance, Jacob Jusu Saffa, catalogued a host of safety net programmes already being implemented by the #NewDirection Government as part of its social safety net agenda, which included cash transfer, #schoolfeeding programs, and increasing the minimum wage. He said they had also supported bailouts to critical agencies that had been affected by the #COVID_19 #pandemic.

Minister of Tourism and Cultural Affairs, Madam Memunatu Pratt, thanked the President for tremendously choosing tourism as one of the growth sectors for the diversification of the country’s economy. She said that the launch of the safety net would help to alleviate the level of poverty, especially for those affected.

President of Hotel Association, Johnny Shallop, said that although their industry was drastically affected by the #COVID_19, they were thankful to the government for the intervention and in easing the effects of the pandemic on them. He expressed gratitude to the President and his government for the initiative and their commitment to the tourism industry.

He assured that the UN was a trusted partner to the country and expressed hope that his successor would continue to provide the necessary support to the government.

“We in the UN commend the government for its decisive actions that have been taken to prevent the early arrival of the #COVID_19 in the country. We continue to stand by the government, both in its public health response and socio-economic response,” he said.

On his part, President Bio expressed gratitude to the out-going UN boss for the many things they had achieved together while he was in country, especially in the areas of sustainable agriculture and food security, climate change, good governance, expanded access to basic services - including #education, #health, water and #sanitation and #energy, protection and #empowerment of the most #vulnerable.

“You have been part of the many processes we have gone through. We are working so hard to keep the Medium-Term Development Plan on track even in the midst of #COVID_19. You have played your own part here and I want to say thank you for being there for us even with the #COVID_19 and wish you all the best.

“I want to thank the United Nations in Sierra Leone for the successful construction of a specialised #COVID_19 treatment Centre at the 34 Hospital and handing over same to the #Government of #SierraLeone as part of the UN’s support to the national #COVID_19 fight,” he concluded.

Sierra Leone's Anti-Corruption Commission Presents 2019 Annual Report to President Julius Maada Bio

State House, Freetown, Thursday 6 August, 2020 - The Anti-Corruption Commission, ACC, has presented its 2019 Annual Report to His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio as part of its obligations and mandate to account for its stewardship.

Its Deputy Commissioner, Augustine Foday Ngobie, said that they were presenting the report in fulfilment of the provision in Section 19(1) of the ACC Act of 2008 as amended, noting that the report comprehensively chronicled the overall activities of the Commission and captured details on all departments for the year under review.

He said that 2019 could be safely described as a year of remarkable success for the Commission, taking into consideration the achievements and success stories both locally and internationally. He also said that they were able to strengthen the Commission through the amendment of the laws which had made corruption a high risk but low return venture.

“Your Excellency, the Commission remains very grateful to you for the determined and inspiring leadership demonstrated towards the fight against corruption and the general work of the Commission. I also extend our thanks to the Ministry of Finance for its support in the payment of salaries, provision of recurrent expenditure and development,” he said.

In his remarks, President Bio started by commending the leadership and staff of the Commission for the report and for their unwavering commitment to the fight against corruption over the last year.

“Since I assumed office, I have prioritised fighting corruption because it is a threat to our development as a nation. A corrupt country is adverse for economic and social development, foreign direct investment, effective service delivery, fairplay and equal opportunity, equal access to justice and the rule of law.

“Today, the presentation of this report gives us an opportunity to reaffirm my Government’s commitment to fighting this war on corruption. As I say often, this is a war we must fight and it is a war we must win,” he said.

“First, in 2019, I signed into law the Anti-Corruption Amendment Act of 2019 in fulfilment of both a manifesto and public commitment I made…second, the Special Anti-Corruption Division was established in the High Court with five (5) dedicated Judges to exclusively sit on ACC cases…

“Third, the Honourable Vice President, Dr. Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh, on behalf of my Government, launched my Government’s strategic blueprint that includes the public and private sectors in fighting corruption…fourth, our international reputation has been enhanced because our international rating on controlling corruption and corruption perception indices are all very favourable…

“Fifth, Sierra Leone scored 79% in the Millennium Challenge Corporation control of corruption indicator. This was an improvement on the 71% score in 2018 during our very first year in office. Clearly, this was a significant improvement on the failing score of 49% scored by our predecessors…sixth, surveys carried out by independent civil society organisations and funded by foreign governments, indicate significant improvements in fighting corruption,” he concluded.

Freetown, Sierra Leone Thursday 30 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has launched the Post-Ebola Recovery Social Investment Fund, PERSIF, project to provide basic social services and support local economic livelihoods and job creation, six years after the deadly outbreak that killed thousands.

The two key components and deliverables of the US$12.4 million project would include basic social service delivery - medical equipment and medicines for #Maternity Centres, Primary Health Units, and Community Health Posts – and local economic livelihoods and job creation with the objective of creating access to finance and support economic activity and cross-border trade.

“As speaker after speaker has noted, #Ebola took a heavier toll on our communities where the disease was most prevalent -- especially on our border and some urban communities. Education, a thriving informal economy, healthcare infrastructure, and basic social services collapsed. In the circumstance, vulnerable populations (orphans, the old, the sick, the disabled, women) fared even worse,” he noted.

The president further pointed out that the socio-economic and health indicators since 2014 were still only marginally better in those communities, adding that six years on the deep and painful footprints of the #Ebola #Virus Epidemic were still with Sierra Leoneans, after it claimed thousands and, most importantly, hundreds of the lives of medical workers.

“To get those vulnerable populations and vulnerable communities on the pathway to inclusive and sustainable development, therefore, we emphasised in various clusters of our Medium-Term National Development Plan (2019-2023) that we must put in place critical enablers of socio-economic development and transformation. These include providing basic social services and the regeneration of local economic activity.

“In our New Direction manifesto, we promised ‘efficient and effective management of the state that will make Sierra Leone a significantly better country through, among other things, inclusive politics, inclusive economic growth, inclusive development.’ This means that vulnerable people and vulnerable communities should be accorded an equal chance to thrive. To our minds, uneven investments in development do not make for sustainable development,” he recalled.

President Bio also noted that the very practical enthusiasm, of his government reworking on that since 2018, demonstrated the premium they placed on the outcomes of the PERSIF project, noting that those results were all critical to the human capital development priorities the New Direction government had set itself.

“It is my fervent hope that this project will be implemented without the usual bottlenecks that forestall progress as it is very important to the lives of beneficiaries in those targeted communities. It is also critical to my Government’s agenda of providing economic opportunity to otherwise vulnerable groups and fully including those populations in the development ecosystem.

“So let me conclude by thanking the African Development Bank Group that has worked in partnership with the multinational agency, Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Initiative, to provide this grant. With their extra pair of hands, my Government has today implemented programmes that will transform local economies, provide opportunity, and transform the lives of vulnerable populations that continue to be adversely affected by the Ebola scourge six years on,” he said.

Minister of Social Welfare, Baindu Dassama-Kamara, emphasised the importance of providing social services in the selected places, restore livelihood and economic opportunities for affected beneficiaries. She disclosed that the Association of Ebola Survivors was actively involved in the implementation process and noted that the project was expected to improve community response to future outbreaks.

Minister of Finance, Jacob Jusu Saffa, said that through effective re-engagement, the #NewDirection Government had been able to salvage the project, adding that that would go a long way to take care of the Ebola survivors who were abandoned by the previous government. He assured of their determination to effectively implement the project.

Country Manager, African Development Bank Group, Dr Peninah Kariuki, said that the project was special because it addressed special needs of communities affected by the #Ebola outbreak by restoring basic social services and reviving local economic opportunities. She also reaffirmed their commitment to working with the various partners to ensuring the timely implementation of the project.

State Lodge, Freetown, Thursday 30 July 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has today presented sheep for slaughter to 300 mosques and households in the Western Area.

Muslims worldwide celebrate this day in remembrance of Prophet Ibrahim’s (Abraham) willingness to slaughter his own son, Ismael before Allah intervened and ordered him to kill a sheep instead.

He said because of the pandemic Muslims could not perform the Hajj this year, which was an important pillar of Islam. He said that Eid Al Adha (tomorrow) was an important date in the Muslim calendar and had called on them to show their love as a family.

“We are doing the special offer to show that we care for everyone with the little we can offer. Religious leaders are important part of our society and that is why we are making this special offer to show that we care for them,” he said.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Launches Sexual Offences Model Court, Praises Hands off Our Girls Initiative

Freetown, Sierra Leone, Friday 24 July 2020 – His Excellency President Julius Maada Bio has launched the country’s first-ever Sexual Offences Model Court, SOMC, in Sierra Leone while saluting the great courage of survivors of Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV).

“Be assured that there are Sierra Leoneans and friends of Sierra Leone who care and who will continue to stand with you steadfastly,” he said adding that he was publicly thanking The First Lady, Madam Fatima Maada Bio, for her tenacity in championing the ’Hands Off Our Girls’ campaign that also promotes the cause for women.

“’Hands Off Our Girls’ is not just a statement, it has become a rallying cry of resistance and a trenchant restatement that we will fight back until we rid this country of SGBV. Thank you Madam First Lady for emboldening young girls and women all over this nation that they can and must say ‘NO’ to predators and molesters.

“Thank you for reminding each one of us (parents, community members, traditional and religious leaders, civil servants, members of the security forces, students, professional organisations, civil society, ordinary citizens, and national leaders) that we can and we must play our part in urgently addressing this national emergency. Let us continue to explore new ways of collaborating very closely to change attitudes and end these crimes,” he said.

The President also acknowledged that economic disparities, cultural attitudes, and some all-round obnoxious attitudes toward women and girls had contributed to the deepening of the said crisis in the country.

“But we are a good people. We are a nation of good people. We should be better. We must do more to rid this nation of this menace. As a Government, we have made an unambiguous statement that there is no place for impunity and every perpetrator will be held accountable within the full remit of all existing laws of our country,” he warned.

President Bio also thanked development partners for sharing his belief that the egregious crime of sexual violence must be tackled head-on, adding that he was particularly recognising the role of the UN Women and UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, and for their vigorous and relentless support to the Government and the judiciary.

“Let me also thank my Lord, The Chief Justice and members of the judiciary for their interminable support in fighting SGBV. Over the last two years, they have made a bold statement of their commitment to right this grave injustice by speedily augmenting every step of the fight against SGBV,” he said.

First Lady, Madam Fatima Maada Bio, said that since the launch of the HOOG Campaign they had succeeded in gradually shifting the culture of silence and indifference about rape, thereby increasing the number of reported cases. She noted that the rate of sexual incidences had also provided the platform for human rights and advocacy organisations and individuals to rally together to end all forms of violence against women and girls in the country.

“As part of government’s commitments to ending all forms of violence against women and girls in Sierra Leone, we are here this morning to make another history as a country by officially launching the SOMC. Even as we gathered here this morning, let us remind ourselves of our constitutional and moral responsibility of safeguarding the rights and future of women and girls,” she said.

Country Representative, UNFPA, Dr Kim Eva Dickson, applauded the Government for the concerted multi-sectoral efforts to prevent and eradicate the scourge of gender-based violence that was eating away the fabric of society. She also congratulated the Judiciary of Sierra Leone on the opening of SOMC, saying that the special measure associated with the specialised court would go a long way to building the confidence of survivors to bring their cases forward.

A representative from Rainbow Center, Dr Olabisi Claudius-Cole, thanked the President and the First Lady for putting the spotlight and raising awareness on the menace in the country. She added that the HOOG campaign had made a big impact and difference. She assured of their continued passion and commitment to providing competent, compassionate and confidential care to survivors of SGBV.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio Encourages Support from Parents and Communities to End Rape in Sierra Leone

State House, Freetown, Tuesday 14 July 2020 - His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has encouraged parents and the community to support government’s efforts in tackling rape, early marriage and all forms of violence against women and girls in the country.

Speaking during a high-level stakeholders’ meeting at State House, the President said that it was the responsibility of government to protect the lives of everyone, adding that that could only be achieved with the involvement of parents and members of the community. He emphasised the need to end all harmful practices that were affecting the growth of women and girls in the country.

The President also used the occasion to commend the Rainbow Initiative for their tenacity in doing a very difficult job and for standing for survivors of rape and sexual violence. He noted that the statistics around rape in the country were grim, adding that that was why he declared a national emergency on rape and sexual violence in February 2019.

“Rape is unacceptable because it is about the future of our children. The parents and communities need to stand up because it is better to work towards prevention. Parents should be attentive to raising our children. There is a need for a multisectoral approach and coordination to get rid of impunity,” he said.

First Lady, Her Excellency Fatima Maada Bio, said that they were meeting to brief the President on the task given to them regarding the “Hands Off Our Girls”, HOOG, campaign and how they could find solutions in dealing with rape, teenage pregnancy and early marriage in the country.

She noted that they had gone right across the country to engage relevant stakeholders and to raise awareness about the dangers of rape and sexual violence against women and girls. She also said that since the launch of the HOOG, they had achieved a lot but would still need the cooperation of everyone if they were to achieve their goals.

Executive Director of Rainbow Initiative, Daniel Kettor, said that there had been a lack of support from the community to survivors, saying that that was affecting the fight against rape. He recommended for the acceleration of the One-Stop Centers, assign medical staff to those centers and to establish more safe homes across the country that would minimise the rate at which society and parents compromise on rape matters.

Acting Chief Electoral Commissioner, Edmond Sylvester Alpha, said that the report covered the profile of the Commission, elections conducted within the period under review and gender analysis on elections, noting that from all indications, there was a marked increase in the participation of women in elections conducted by the Commission in 2019.

“The Commission reiterates its commitment in strengthening collaboration and greater engagement with government, international partners and key stakeholders for the conduct of credible and transparent elections that meet international standards and the expectations of the people of Sierra Leone,” he said.

In his response, the President thanked the Commission for doing a good job, saying that despite it being a difficult one their job was important in the promotion of democracy in the country. He further implored them to do more about integrity and emphasised that their proper functioning would go a long way to determine the trajectory of democracy in the country.

He also welcomed the progress the Commission had made so far by paying specific attention to gender and disability issues as key pillars in their various initiatives. He added that they wanted to make the process inclusive at all times because of their commitment to inclusive development.

He also assured that government would continue to endeavour to make sure that adequate funding was given to financing the activities of the Commission and implored them to continue to do their best to provide the stability needed for development.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio unveils Support to Civil Society, Local Authorities

UNIMAK, Makeni, Northern Province Friday 10 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has launched the ‘Support to Civil Society and Local Authorities for Local Development’ Project in Makeni to support local development in agriculture, infrastructure, energy, health, education, gender and social protection.

The five-year European Union grant will target District Councils and respective Civil Society Organisations (CSOs) in Pujehun, Kenema, Bombali and Kambia – to further expand their resource base and institutional capacities to deliver and account for services, bolster linkages and relationships with rural civil societies, and improve the environment for effective decentralisation and local governance.

“The Minister has highlighted my Government’s core achievements over the last two years. From over ten years of dwindling funding, my Government has provided more funds and increased salaries and compensation for local government officials. At the same time, we are working on restructuring and expanding the resource base and institutional capacities of local councils so that they can deliver and account for services in a sustainable way.

“I am particularly pleased about the participation of civil society organisations in formulating, planning, and assessing local development initiatives. Beyond the fact that this fosters a unique and strategic partnership, it also enhances proper accountability for development funds.

“So my expectation is that CSOs should insist on being involved in identifying development priorities and be fully involved in the budget formulation, approval, execution, and monitoring process,” he said, adding that the five-year EU and government programme aligned both with his manifesto commitments and the national development priorities.

“Let me also publicly thank the European Union for its collaborative work with the Sierra Leone Association of Journalists on the TRUEtok bot Corona series. It is regularly broadcast over several media and engages young persons and the public on topics around Corona.

“For all the good work you continue to do, thank you, Ambassador Vens. You are helping save lives. Our high recovery rates and the comparatively low death rates from COVID-19 is cause for optimism. It is also testament to the great spirit of collaboration that is engendered in our relationship with the European Union,” he said.

Minister of Finance, Jacob Jusu Saffa, said that the New Direction Government had manifested more commitment in decentralisation than any other government had done, noting that they had significantly increased expenditure on local councils. He also disclosed that the government had started paying salaries to local council leaders, increased sitting fees to all local councils in the country and were finalising arrangements for the payment of salaries for paramount chiefs and their key staff.

Minister of Local Government and Rural Development, Tamba Lamina, commended the government for the level of support they had given to local councils, saying that that was a manifestation of President Bio’s commitment to the decentralisation process in the country. He stated that they had commenced the process of developing a strategic plan that would engage local stakeholders and development partners while commending the EU for their support to that process.

Head of European Union Delegation in Sierra Leone, Ambassador Tom Vens, said that the aim of the project was to support effective decentralisation and efficient service delivery to the citizens, especially in remote areas. He said that the project would contribute to economic growth and social cohesion for the benefit of Sierra Leone. He also acknowledged the President’s strategy and long-term vision in placing decentralisation at the core of the government’s New Direction.

Sierra Leone’s President Julius Maada Bio unveils One-Stop Centres, Says among Early Adopters of the Concept in Africa

State House, Freetown, Thursday 9 July 2020 – His Excellency President Dr Julius Maada Bio has told a virtual meeting of the diplomatic community and United Nations leadership in Sierra Leone that the one-stop centres initiative to address Sexual and Gender-based Violence (SGBV) cases in referral hospitals is innovative.

“I am proud that we are early adopters of the concept in Africa. We are the second country to adopt One Stop Centres for SGBV response and one of only nine countries in the entire Africa. I am pleased that the six pilot centres will provide one-stop locations for multi-sectoral response services that support survivors," he said.

He said he was particularly happy to learn that the initiative would ensure confidentiality while offering psychosocial counselling, free medical examination and treatment, legal support, and access to safe homes and other referral pathways.

“I acknowledge the recent media furore over the establishment of a Presidential Task Force to advise on rape and…SGBV. At a point, it was a good idea. But the issue of SGBV is so serious that an ad hoc, problem-solving approach is inadequate to address its full implications for inclusive and equal rights, inclusive education and health, inclusive and equal access to opportunity, and inclusive development.

“So late in 2019, I decided instead to set up a stand-alone Ministry of Gender and Children’s Affairs with focused political leadership and a full complement of professional staff who would advise the presidency and national government on gender, draw up appropriate legislation, coordinate partnerships, collaborate across ministries and with international and local partners, engage community stakeholders, make and implement policies, monitor and evaluate programmes, and do even much more. This is far more than an ad-hoc advisory task force,” he recalled.

President Bio further noted that even with the myriad of problems they tackled head-on every day, government’s focus was to provide a more permanent fix for SGBV because the future of the nation depended on women, constituting 51 per cent of its population.

Minister of Gender and Children’s Affairs, Manti Tarawalli, said that the ultimate goal of the centres was to ensure that survivors no longer had to go to the police stations to report cases of SGBV, adding that that singular action would improve on the quality of statement and set the stage for thorough investigations.

Executive Director for UN Women, Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, commended the President and Government of Sierra Leone for the launch of the initiative, saying that it was another step that marked progress. She said the centre was a clear indication of the urgent need to tackle rape as a weapon of war against women and girls. She also thanked the President for his efforts to make sure that perpetrators faced the law.

UN Resident Coordinator, Sunil Saigal, congratulated the government for the development in the middle of a difficult situation. He said that the establishment of the facility had been a pressing priority in the efforts to improve on the conditions of women and girls in the country, including addressing the need for access to justice, medical, legal and other support for survivors of sexual and gender-based violence.

He noted that the move was one of several important initiatives that had been taken by the government to address issues of women and girls and assured of UN’s support to the prevention of women and girls against all forms of violence in the country.
